There are multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer T, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:
The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of vertices.
Each of the next N - 1 lines contains three space separated integers a, b and c denoting an edge between a and b, whose weight is c.
The next line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries.
Each of the next Q lines contains a single integer s.
1 ≤ T ≤ 25
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Q ≤ 10
1 ≤ a, b ≤ N
0 ≤ c, s ≤ 10^5
It is guaranteed that given edges form a tree.
